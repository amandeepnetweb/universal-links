Google provides several types of system images for Android emulators, each serving different use cases. Here's a breakdown of the **types of emulator system images**, including **user**, **userdebug**, and **eng** images.

---

## üß© Android Emulator Image Types

### 1. **`user` Image (Production)**

* ‚úÖ Default image used in most official emulator builds (e.g., `Google APIs` image)
* üîí **No root access**
* üö´ `adb root` **won‚Äôt work**: `adbd cannot run as root in production builds`
* ‚úÖ Suitable for testing production-like behavior

**Examples:**

* `Google Play x86_64`
* `Google APIs x86_64`
* **Used for testing apps under Play Store rules**

---

### 2. **`userdebug` Image**

* üõ† A mix of production and development features
* ‚úÖ Supports **`adb root`**, **`adb remount`**, `su`, etc.
* ‚úÖ Ideal for debugging, inspecting `/data/data`, modifying system files
* ‚úÖ More secure than `eng` but more permissive than `user`
* ‚úÖ You can **start the shell as root**

> Not available directly in Android Studio‚Äôs Device Manager for all API levels.

You can download via command line (see below üëá)

---

### 3. **`eng` Image (Engineering)**

* üîì Fully open system image for platform developers
* üß™ Has many debugging tools, logs, and services
* ‚ùó Insecure and not optimized
* ‚úÖ Full root access, all system flags disabled

---

## üéØ How to Check the Type of Your Running Emulator

```bash
adb shell getprop ro.build.type
```

Typical values:

* `user` = production
* `userdebug` = debug-enabled
* `eng` = engineering

---

## üì¶ Available Image Types in Android Studio

In **Android Studio > Device Manager > Create Device > System Image**:

* **Google Play** ‚Üí `user`
* **Google APIs** ‚Üí `user`
* **AOSP x86/x86\_64** ‚Üí varies; may allow root (closer to `userdebug`)
* **Android Automotive OS / Android TV** ‚Üí some include `userdebug`

To get `userdebug` or `eng` images, you'll often need to:

---

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download Debug Images from AOSP (Command Line)

```bash
sdkmanager --install "system-images;android-30;google_apis_playstore;x86_64"
sdkmanager --install "system-images;android-30;default;x86_64"
```

To find more:

```bash
sdkmanager --list | grep system-images
```

---

## üõ† Recommended: Use AOSP x86\_64 or ARM64 for Root Access

In Android Studio:

1. Go to **Device Manager > Create Virtual Device**
2. Choose a system image:

   * **`AOSP x86_64`** (more permissive)
   * Avoid **Google Play** images if you need root

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Image Type  | `adb root` | Suitable for               |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| `user`      | ‚ùå          | Production testing         |
| `userdebug` | ‚úÖ          | App and platform debugging |
| `eng`       | ‚úÖ          | Deep system-level testing  |

Let me know what API level and use case you want (root access vs production testing), and I‚Äôll recommend a specific image you can install.
